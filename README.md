# Analyzing-International-Debt-Statistics
In this project, I analyzed international debt data sourced from The World Bank to answer three key questions: the number of distinct countries in the database, which country holds the highest debt, and which has the lowest repayments. By carefully exploring and manipulating the dataset, I showcased my proficiency in data analysis techniques such as data cleaning, aggregation, and calculation of summary statistics. This project not only honed my skills in handling real-world datasets but also underscored my ability to derive meaningful insights crucial for informed decision-making in economic and financial contexts.
